# Text Extractors
Some important factors to note are that in  designing the text extractors, we chose to have different python files for each language and that for each file being extracted from there are 6 output files. 

The decision for a different python text extractor file for each language stems from the fact that each language while similar in setup usually has minor differences and to avoid consistent changes to one python file for all languages it seemed more appropriate to have different fiels for each language that cater to each of the small differences. 

The reason we chose to have 6 output files for each file extracted from is to help identify where possibly issues leading to a blank full document stem from. Sometimes even in the same language, files have small differences such as "alignment" vs "alignmentS" which can lead to errors in reading from documents and can ultimately lead to blacnk documents when trying to process the full putput (sentence, sentence level UMR graph, alignment, and document level UMR graph). In order to avoid manualy digging through files to find minute errors it is easier to print out each section in indiviual files to find if any of them are blank and if one is blank then you can quickly correct how the method is reading from the document. Additonally, printing the individual files helped to verify that each section was being collected correctly much faster than analizing the full documents.
